// Your JS can go here! Pull in or write whatever you want.
//
// For example, to add in Bootstrap 4 JS (I know, this sucks):
// jQuery is already being pulled in via the Webpack file.
//
import '../../node_modules/bootstrap/js/dist/button.js';
//
// It's recommended that you only pull in the Bootstrap modules you need.
